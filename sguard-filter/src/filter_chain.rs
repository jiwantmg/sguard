        // Build the filter chain in reverse order. Building the filter chain in reverse
        // order is a common pattern in middleware and filter frameworks, particularly in web
        // servers and processing pipelines. Hereâ€™s why this approach is used
        // Why Build in Reverse Order?
        // 1. Chain Execution Order:
        //      a. When you build the chain in reverse order, you ensure that filters are applied
        //         in the order you want them to be executed.
        //      b. For example, if you have filters A, B, and C, and you want them to process requests
        //         in the order A -> B -> C, building the chain in reverse (starting from C and adding
        //         A last) ensures that requests pass through A first and then proceed to B and C.
        // 2. Handler Composition:
        //      a. Each filter typically wraps the next filter in the chain. If you start building the chain
        //         from the end (i.e., from the filter that should handle the request last), each filter can
        //         wrap the previous filter's handler.
        //      b. By the time you finish building the chain, the first filter you added (A) will be the
        //         outermost filter, and the last filter you added (C) will be the innermost filter.
